## My process

Started with mobile first design, set everything right and then moved to the desktop version of the site.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I still need to figure out how to use widths and heights, and how they are inherited. Spent too much time with adjusting those values.
